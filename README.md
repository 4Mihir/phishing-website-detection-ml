# Phishing Website Detection using Machine Learning

Final Year Project – BSc Computer Science  
University of West London

## Project Overview
This project investigates the use of machine learning techniques to detect phishing websites based on URL and domain-related features. Multiple classification models are implemented and evaluated to compare their effectiveness in identifying malicious websites.

## Objectives
- Extract lexical and structural features from URLs
- Train and evaluate multiple ML classifiers
- Compare models using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
- Analyse limitations and real-world applicability

## Project Structure
- `data/` – datasets (raw and processed)
- `notebooks/` – exploratory analysis
- `src/` – core implementation (feature extraction, training, evaluation)
- `models/` – saved trained models
- `reports/` – figures and results for final report

## Technologies
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn
