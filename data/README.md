Binary classification problem:

Input:
- A website URL string

Output:
- 1 = Phishing
- 0 = Legitimate

Primary evaluation metric:
- F1-score (phishing class)

Additional metrics:
- Precision
- Recall
- ROC-AUC

Rationale:
Phishing datasets can be imbalanced. F1-score provides a balanced measure between precision and recall.
